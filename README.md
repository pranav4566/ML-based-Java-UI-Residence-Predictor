# ML-based-Java-UI-Residence-Predictor
When people consider buying a home or property, they first tend to go online to try trends and other related research. The proposed system presents a console application in Java that can predict house prices using machine learning algorithms based on data mining concepts that extract relevant knowledge from raw data and perform practical analysis. The system proposed here analyzes related properties for predicting the prices. Using the wide varieties of libraries available in Python, the proposed system attempts to implement a way to create user interfaces in Java by interacting with Java and Python machine learning model. Random Forest Regression model has been used to predict the prices with an R-squared score of 86.72%. The proposed system implements a JAVA graphical user interface using Swing technology which is simple and lightweight
